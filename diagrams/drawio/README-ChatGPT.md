The first open source equivalent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has arrived, but good luck running it on your laptop — or at all.

This week, Philip Wang, the developer responsible for reverse-engineering closed-sourced AI systems including Meta’s Make-A-Video, released PaLM + RLHF, a text-generating model that behaves similarly to ChatGPT. The system combines PaLM, a large language model from Google, and a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback — RLHF, for short — to create a system that can accomplish pretty much any task that ChatGPT can, including drafting emails and suggesting computer code.

The ChatGPT general-purpose chatbot prototype developed by OpenAI is now available as a free research preview and anyone can try it out.

A confident bullshitter that can write very convincing nonsense’: not a takedown of an annoying student or a former British prime minister, but a description of an artificial intelligence writing programme that is causing headaches for its makers.

ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)[1] is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. Its uneven factual accuracy was identified as a significant drawback.[2]

Why Everyone's Obsessed With ChatGPT, a Mind-Blowing AI Chatbot

This artificial intelligence bot can answer questions and write essays and program computers. But careful how much you trust it

It's a big deal. The tool seems pretty knowledgeable in areas where there's good training data for it to learn from. It's not omniscient or smart enough to replace all humans yet, but it can be creative, and its answers can sound downright authoritative. A few days after its launch, more than a million people were trying out ChatGPT.

Stack Overflow Bans ChatGPT For Constantly Giving Wrong Answers
One of the internet’s largest coding resources has temporarily banned the AI chatbot after users answered programming questions with its responses.

“Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking or looking for correct answers,” the site’s moderators wrote in a post on the site’s “meta” forum. “The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting.”

The Brilliance and Weirdness of ChatGPT
A new chatbot from OpenAI is inspiring awe, fear, stunts and attempts to circumvent its guardrails.

GPT-4 stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4. It’s basically an artificial intelligence system that can create human-like text.

Use this to create content for a YouTube channel

While the current ChatGPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, ChatGPT-4 might have 1 trillion, or even more, according to some reports. Similarly, it will be capable of text answering, content generation, language translation, and text summarization, just like the current ChatGPT-3.
